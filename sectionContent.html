	      The Quran is the holy book ascribed to by over 1.5 billion Muslims across the world. Muslims worship the same God as Jews and Christians, and they believe the Quran to be the direct word of God transmitted through the final prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). On the left, you can see a searchable/dynamic representation of the Quran and an English translation by Yusuf Ali*. You can mouse-over each Aya (section) to highilhgt it and see what it says.

	    	Muhammad did not know how to read or write, nor did he have knowledge of previous scriptures. He lived in Mecca in the Arabian peninsula at a time of idolatry, social corruption, and injustice. Muslims believe that the angel Gabriel visited Muhammad while he was meditating in the cave of Hira.

	    	The angel Gabriel informed the illiterate Muhammad to recite the Quran. The words were captured in the chapter Al-Alaq.

	    	The Quran is a compilation of revelations that Muhammad received as the final prophet. The Quran is organized into 114 chapters (Surahs). Every chapter, except one, begins with the line: 
	    	
	    	<p>
	    	<img src="images/bismillah.jpg" width=100%>

	    	<p>
	    	In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.

	    	<p>
	    	Muslims begin almost everything they do with this line, including eating, traveling, and business dealings.

	    	<p>
	    	The Quran is not organized in chronological order of revelation. Instead, it was compiled according to an order of recitation described by the prophet. Many of the beginning Surah's are long, and many at the end are shorter. In addition, the book is also organized into 30 sections of equal parts. This is useful for those who are reciting the Quran during the month of Ramadan. Each column in the visualization represents a different section.

	    	The first chapter in the Quran is referred to as the "Opening" (Al-Fatiha). It is composed of seven lines. These are recited in each cycle of every muslim prayer. The lines go:

	    	Since the Quran is assumed to be from the same source as the Gospel and the Torah, it is no surprise that there is mention of the same stories and people. The written Quran was compiled very quickly after Muhammad's death, within the lifeteimes of those who had memorized it. Manuscripts have been discovered and radio-carbon dated to the time of the Prophet.

	    	<p>
	    	In Islam, Muhammad, Jesus, Moses, and all the prophets are considered non-divine humans who deliver the message of God to the believers. Muslims believe in the virgin-birth of Jesus, but the Quran is clear that he was not divine and was not the son of God. That doesn't stop Jesus from playing a central role in Islam. Jesus is mentioned by name 25 times in the Quran, while Muhammad is mentioned only 4 times by name.

	    	<p>
	    	Here we highlight all the times Jesus is mentioned in white and Mary in yellow.
